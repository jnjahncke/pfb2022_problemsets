runnin' down a dream
by tom petty
it was a beautiful day, the sun beat down
i had the radio on, i was drivin'
trees flew by, me and del were singin' little runaway
i was flyin'
yeah runnin' down a dream
that never would come to me
workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads
runnin' down a dream
i felt so good like anything was possible
i hit cruise control and rubbed my eyes
the last three days the rain was unstoppable
it was always cold, no sunshine
yeah runnin' down a dream
that never would come to me
workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads
runnin' down a dream
i rolled on as the sky grew dark
i put the pedal down to make some time
there's something good waitin' down this road
i'm pickin' up whatever's mine
yeah runnin' down a dream
that never would come to me
workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads
runnin' down a dream
